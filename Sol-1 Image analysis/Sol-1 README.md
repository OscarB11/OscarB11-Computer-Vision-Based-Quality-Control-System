# Sol-1: Reference-Based Image Comparison for Quality Control

## Overview
This solution implements an intelligent comparison system that evaluates product quality by comparing test images against reference standards. The system uses advanced cropping algorithms to isolate areas of interest and then highlights differences between the reference and test images, making defect detection straightforward and accurate.

## Key Components
- **Automatic Cropping Algorithm**: Precisely isolates regions of interest for focused comparison
- **Reference Image Registration**: Aligns test images with reference standards for pixel-perfect comparison
- **Difference Highlighting**: Visually emphasizes deviations from the reference standard
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjustable thresholds for detecting minor to significant deviations
- **Visualization Tools**: Generates clear visual reports of detected anomalies

## Technical Implementation
- Intelligent cropping using contour detection and geometric analysis
- Image registration with feature matching for precise alignment
- Pixel-by-pixel difference computation with noise filtering
- Color-coded visualization of deviations by severity
- Multi-format export of comparison results

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV 4.5+
- NumPy 1.19+
- Matplotlib 3.3+ (for visualization)
- scikit-image 0.18+ (for advanced filters)

## Configuration
The system is highly configurable through the `config.json` file:
- `detection_sensitivity`: Controls threshold for difference detection (0.0-1.0)
- `crop_margins`: Extra padding around automatically detected regions of interest
- `use_histogram_matching`: Enable color/intensity normalization before comparison
- `feature_matching_algorithm`: Select between "SIFT", "ORB", or "BRISK" for alignment
- `output_format`: Configure result output format and detail level

## Usage Example
```python
from qc_analyzer import ImageAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = ImageAnalyzer(config_path='config.json')

# Process single image against reference
results = analyzer.compare('test_image.jpg', 'reference_image.jpg')

# Visualize results with differences highlighted
analyzer.visualize_results(results, output_path='report.jpg')
```
