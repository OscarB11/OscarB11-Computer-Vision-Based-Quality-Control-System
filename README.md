# OscarB11-Computer-Vision-Based-Quality-Control-System
The aim of this project is to design and implement a computer vision-based quality control system that can identify defects and anomalies in manufacturing processes. The system will use cameras to capture images of products or parts on the production line, and will analyze these images to identify any deviations from quality standards. The system will then alert relevant personnel so that corrective action can be taken.
