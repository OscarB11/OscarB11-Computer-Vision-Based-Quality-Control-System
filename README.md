# Computer Vision-Based PCB Quality Control System

The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision-based quality control system capable of identifying defects and anomalies in printed circuit boards (PCBs). The system uses cameras to capture images of PCBs on the production line and analyses them to detect any deviations from quality standards. Once a defect is detected, the system alerts relevant personnel so corrective action can be taken promptly.
